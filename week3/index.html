                I like this poem, I also have a poem I want to tell you
                <i>
                </br>
                Who said: ‘Two vast and trunkless legs of stone</br>
                Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand,</br>
                Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,</br>
                And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,</br>
                Tell that its sculptor well those passions read</br>
                Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,</br>
                The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.</br>
                </i>
