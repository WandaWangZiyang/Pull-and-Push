                <b>Hi!</b></br>
                There is a little beautiful poem I would like to tell you！</br>
                </br>
                <b>The Flower and the Nausea</b></br>
                <i>
                </br>
                A flower has sprouted in the street!</br>
                Buses, street cars, steel stream of traffic: steer clear.</br>
                A flower, still pale, has fooled the police,</br>
                it’s breaking through the asphalt.</br>
                Let’s have complete silence, halt all business.</br>
                I swear that a flower has been born.</br>
                Its color is uncertain</br>
                It’s not showing its petals</br>
                Its name isn’t in the books</br>
                It is ugly. But it really is a flower</br>
                I sit down on the ground of the nation’s capital at five in the afternoon,</br>
                and fondle with my fingers this precarious form</br> 
                It is ugly. But it is a flower.</br>
                It broke the asphalt, the tedium, the disgust and the hatred.</br>
